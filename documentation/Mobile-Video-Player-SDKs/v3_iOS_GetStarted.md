This article will help you get started with the development of Kaltura's Video Player SDK for iOS.

## Before You Begin  

Recommended reading before you begin:

1. [**Media Providers**](https://github.com/kaltura/DeveloperPortalDocs/blob/mobilePlayerSDKV3/documentation/Mobile-Video-Player-SDKs/v3_iOS_ConnectingServices.md): These are components that are capable of loading media data as PKMediaEntry representation.
2. [**CocoaPods**](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) The Kaltura Video Player SDK for iOS and its plugins can be added to your project using the CocoaPods dependency manager. 

>Note: You'll need to use CocoaPods version 1.0 or newer.
