This article will help you get started with the development of the Playkit for iOS.

## Before You Begin  

Before you begin development with PlayKit for iOS, there are a few topics you should read up on first:

1. [**Media Providers**](https://vpaas.kaltura.com/documentation/Mobile-Video-Player-SDKs/iOS_MediaProviders.html): These are components that are capable of loading media data as PKMediaEntry representation.
2. [**CocoaPods**](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) The PlayKit iOS SDK and its plugins can be added to your project using the CocoaPods dependency manager. 

>Note: You'll need to use CocoaPods version 1.0 or newer.

## System Requirements
