This article will help you get started with the development of the Playkit for iOS.

## Before You Begin  

Before you begin development with PlayKit for iOS, there are a few topics you should read up on first:

1. [**Media Providers**](https://github.com/kaltura/DeveloperPortalDocs/blob/playkit/documentation/PlayKit/iOS_MediaProviders.md): These are components that are capable of loading media data as PKMediaEntry representation.
2. [**CocoaPods**](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) The PlayKit iOS SDK and its plugins can be added to your project using the CocoaPods dependency manager. 

>Note: You'll need to use CocoaPods version 1.0 or newer.

## System Requirements  

* [iOS 9 and above](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS9.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016198-SW1)

## Project Setup
