Media Providers:

Provides a tool for creating a well known media object with the relevant data needed for the Video Player.

The providers are configured with the relevant parameters, and when activated using "load", will send requests 
to the relevant data source to gather the data needed for the play. The data is parsed and the providers 
will output a PKMediaEntry object.

There are three implementation options currently available:

* MockMediaProvider
* PhoenixMediaProvider
* KalturaOvpMediaProvider
