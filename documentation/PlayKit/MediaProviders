Media Providers:

provides a tool to create a well known media object with the relevant data needed for the player.

The providers are configured with the relevant parameters, and when activated "load", sends requests 
to the relevant data source to gather the data needed for the play. The data is parsed and the providers 
outputs a PKMediaEntry object.

Currently there are 3 implementation:
1. MockMediaProvider

2. PhoenixMediaProvider

3. KalturaOvpMediaProvider
