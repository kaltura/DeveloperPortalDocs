Use this page to mark the location of your page in the site using weights.
For example:
Introduction 100
Getting started 101

Etc.


Images should be added in the following way:
1. Create a subfolder called images by adding a new file called images:<foldername>/images/,Adding the comma tells github that you are creating folder rather than a page.
Confirm adding the new file.
Next, when creating your page, use the following format in the page to add the image:![Description of the image](./images/<imagename>.png) 
Important! Donâ€™t forget to add a description to the image!!
