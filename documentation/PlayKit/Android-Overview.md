This document is the main source of documentation for developers working with Kaltura's Android Player SDK project. Here you will find the information you need to get started developing your software using the SDK. The SDK provides tools to help you easily embed the Kaltura Player into native environments in your Android applications.

If this is your first time hearing about Kaltura, we recommend you read up on Kaltura in the [Kaltura website](http://corp.kaltura.com/).
