When considering video SEO, where the URL of the video file and Player is actually hosted is not very important nor does it influence the search results ranking in any way.
The main elements are the data Google is able to find on your page, including: title, description, thumbnail, proper schema.org tags, Facebook OG tags, etc.

### Getting Started with Video SEO  

To get started with video SEO, we recommend you first read this [article](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/videosearch/intro) from Google.

Additionally, the following are specific steps you can take to improve your video SEO:

1.	Always include a proper description meta tag (read this [article](https://www.site-analyzer.com/en/blog/17-How+to+write+bad+meta+descriptions) for more details). 
2.	Use Schema.org for Videos tags properly. See attached for comparison between their current embed code, and how it should be.
3.	There is a huge miss on social sharing since they’re not using proper OpenGraph tags for video (instead their pages are marked as articles).  
1.	That’s also a miss with Google, since Google does indeed read the OpenGraph tags.
2.	They should render the video inline the feed (Facebook wall, Twitter feed, etc). They also only use og:tags for Facebook, I’d recommend including Twitter Card tags.
4.	Lastly, the important piece of the SEO puzzle is the Video SiteMap and submitting it to Google WebMasters Tools.

2.	Create your video sitemap using the Syndication tab under Content in the Kaltura Management Console (direct link).

NOTE: It can take up to 3 weeks for Google to index after you’ve made the needed changes. 
Waiting period of 10 - 15 days before seeing the changes in Google’s search results is not uncommon.


And another small tip for their overall SEO:
* SSL is disabled on their domain; Google favors SSL enabled pages (https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/12/indexing-https-pages-by-default.html)

Another tip for their social networks sharing:
* I would make sure to add the Embed.ly player plugin (via the Player Studio).
