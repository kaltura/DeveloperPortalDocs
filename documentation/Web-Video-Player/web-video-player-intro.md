The easiest way to use Kaltura's Web Player is to build a player using [Kaltura's Universal Studio](https://knowledge.kaltura.com/node/1148), which provides a user-friendly UI for building and customizing the player. 

Here are some of the key advantages of the Kaltura Web Player:

### Embed Code Types  

Kaltura's Web Player supports the following embed code types:

* **Dynamic:** Dynamic embed has many benefits over object tag or Flash library rewrites; it's fast, doesn't have to wait for DOM, and ready to output the Flash or HTML5 player. This embed is also clean, uses json embed config for flashvars and params dynamic, better supports dynamic html5 and flash embed methods, responsive web design, and css inheritance.
* **Auto:** This type of embed is best for sites where SEO is already covered by other data in the page. This concise Auto embed code is good for quickly getting a player or widget onto the page without any runtime customisations.
* **Thumbnail:** The thumbnail embed method takes the same arguments as "kWidget.embed".This embed will pass all configurations to the kWidget embed when the user "clicks" the play button. The player context menu can be disabled by setting the "EmbedPlayer.DisableContextMenu" UIVar to true.
* **Responsive:** This embed ensures that the video ratio on the screen responds to sizing changes. The minimal RWD self contained maintains a 16/9 ratio, even when you resize the browser window.
* **Reference Id:** The reference ID is used for setting a custom ID for Kaltura entry.
* **kWidget playlist:** kWidgets make it easy to embed playlists, by simply passing along playlist plugin configuration as flashvars.
