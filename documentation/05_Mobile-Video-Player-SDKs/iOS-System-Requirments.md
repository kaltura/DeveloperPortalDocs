To integrate the Kaltura Player iOS SDK, the minimum system requirements are:
* IDE: Xcode version 7 or later (we recommend the latest version) 
* OS version: iOS 8 or later
* CocoaPods (you can find information on CocoaPods [here](www.cocoapods.org))

## Developer Skills  
Developers should have some background knowledge and experience with system setup before building Mobile SDK applications. 

The required developer skillset includes:
* Familiarity with video delivery formats, ad delivery, DRM (when needed), login and passcode flows (these are essential for designing and debugging Mobile SDK applications).
* At least 1-2 years of experience with the relative coding language Objective-C (for iOS development)
* Hybrid requirement: Proficiency in HTML5 and JavaScript languages.
